      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got a great idea for your startup, and a great team, but how do you get started with Azure to build this solution? So you go to the Azure portal or have a look at the list of the Azure services and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of services there. Azure can solve all the world&amp;rsquo;s problems but you just want to get started so what to do?
First thing I&amp;rsquo;d say is to keep it as simple as possible.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of blogs and published contents in different places - the most recent being at http://blog.next-genit.co.uk/. So why create a new blog now? Well hopefully this post will explain a bit more!
The main reason was because I started a new role (CTO in residence at Microsoft for Startups), along with wanting to talk more about my autism, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d better do a blog a bit more technical than just using something like Blogger or pre-packaged Wordpress.</description>
